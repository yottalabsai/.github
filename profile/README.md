# Yotta Labs

> **The AI-native operating system for GPU-scale ML workloads.**

We make elastic GPU compute fast, accessible, and production-ready — so engineers can ship models, not manage infrastructure.

## What We Build

| Product | Description |
|---|---|
| **Compute Pods** | Instant-ready GPU environments on H100/200, B200/300 and beyond |
| **Launch Templates** | Pre-configured deployment templates for zero-friction project starts |
| **Elastic Deployment** | Auto-scaling inference and training across regions |
| **Model APIs** | Unified routing across model providers for cost and latency optimization |
| **Quantization Tools** | Compress models for faster inference with minimal accuracy loss |

## Open Source

### 🐝 BloomBee

Run large language models in **decentralized, heterogeneous environments** with computational offloading. Built for teams that need to push inference beyond centralized data centers.

→ [BloomBee GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ai-decentralized/BloomBee)

### ⚡ NeuronMM

A high-performance **matrix multiplication kernel** for LLM inference on AWS Trainium. Minimizes data movement across memory hierarchies, maximizes SRAM and compute engine utilization, and eliminates expensive matrix transpose operations. Achieves up to **2.22× kernel-level speedup** and **2.49× end-to-end LLM inference speedup** with a 4.78× reduction in HBM-SBUF memory traffic.

### 🔴 AMD Kernel

High-performance **distributed GPU kernels for AMD MI300X** accelerators, optimizing the primitives that power modern LLMs — all-to-all communication (MoE), GEMM-ReduceScatter (tensor parallelism), and AllGather-GEMM (distributed inference). Built with zero-copy IPC and XCD-aware scheduling across 8 compute dies.
